# Welcome to my final project for INF655

## A quick overview:

This is a movie site that gets movies from a database and shows them on the site. By default you are loaded into the Home screen which shows previews of the favorites list, the popular list, and the upcoming list. There are 4 main pages to the site: a home page, a favorites page, a popular page, and an upcoming page. These pages show their respective movies. All movies are clickable and will open the movie popover when clicked. This movie popover will show the movie details including the title, director, release date, rating, a button to add to favorites, and a button to watch the trailer. There is also a header for this site. The header includes a home icon which will direct the user to the home page when clicked. The header also includes a title and a search icon. When clicked, the search icon will open a search popover that will allow the user to search for a movie. This will return movies with titles related to the search phrase entered. These movies are clickable in the search list and will open the movie popover. The website saves to local storage meaning the movies selected in the favorites list will remain there even after the user has closed the browser.

# I hope you enjoy the site!
